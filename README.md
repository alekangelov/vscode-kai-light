# Alek Kai Theme
The tubular VS Code Theme that will blow your socks off!  
  
I developed this one for myself and it has gone a multitude of revisions in order to get to this level. It came out of a necessity to develop a system with great readability a contrast in order for light theme users to not get eye fatique. I, personally love light themes. Black on white is easier to read for me since I've always been a pen and paper kinda guy. Hoping you like it.  
  
The theme itself includes two themes and I plan to expand and adding on to it. If need be, I'll develop more and more themes with developer happiness as priority numero uno! üôèüòé
